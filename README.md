# Undercooked bootloader
---
A 4 KB UEFI buggy as hell bootloader written in FASM. It was written for a unfinished kernel so some of its features(custom memory map parsing, table relocation) were geared specifically for it.
It won't be finished, it's here for preservational and educational purposes.
